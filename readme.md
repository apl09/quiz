## 📝 Project Description

<p>I am trying in this proyect to implement, the AXIOS method to get information from an API, then process it and form a QUIZ with ten questions on it. In the VIEW RESULTS parts, i implemented the Chart JS to show the results of the QUIZ</p>

## About the project

### 🎯 Objectives

<ol>
  <li><strong>Analyze</strong> AXIOS, SPA, CHART JS</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment</strong> using this methods to build a QUiz .</li>
  <li><strong>Optimize</strong> the user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrate</strong> JavaScript to enhance interactivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Customize</strong> and adapt styles.</li>
</ol>

### 📁 Views

<ol>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>Log in</li>
  <li>Cards</li>
</ol>

### 🔬 Methodology

<strong>Research and experimentation:</strong> i've gathered relevant information about  JS, HTML, and CSS from reliable sources. Then, we applied these concepts in examples and projects to explore the capabilities of jS. I compared and evaluated the results obtained in different contexts.

<strong>Practical experimentation:</strong> I created a development environment and carried out a series of examples and projects to apply the learned concepts and explore the capabilities of SPA.

<strong>Analysis and comparison:</strong> I compared and evaluated the results obtained by using AXIOS in combination with JS, HTML, and CSS in different contexts.

<strong>Documentation:</strong> I maintained a detailed record of our research process, including the steps followed, the problems encountered, and the implemented solutions.

## 📊 Bootstrap Practice & Validations

<p>I created a QUIZ APP that meets the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>[x] DOM manipulation</li>           
    <li>[x] Use of the local storage, put information, then retrieve it</li>
    <li>[x] Chart JS to implement the results with graphics with real info from the quiz</li>
    <li>[x] SPA to change between views without the need of changing to diferent pages</li>     
</ul>

## 🧠 Conclusions

<p>In conclusion, this research project has allowed me to explore and deeply understand the potential of JS and DOM manipulation, HTML, and CSS. I have discovered that lots of things can be done when combining this programing lenguages is a valuable tool for web development. </p>
